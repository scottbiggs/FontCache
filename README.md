# FontCache
Easy class for safely using custom fonts without the memory leaks that Android phones tend to have.

##### USAGE:
    Just add this class to your Android project.  Call FontCache.get() each time you need to access
    a custom font (see docs on the get() method for details).  It's all static, so no initializations
    or instantiations are necessary.
